Program 1
Aim:
To study and implement Classes and Objects in C++.

Apparatus:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC or Turbo C++)

Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio)

Algorithm:
Define a class with attributes and methods to represent real-world entities.

Create an object of the class.

Access class members using the object.

Display the result (e.g., volume) to verify correct implementation.

Conclusion:
Program 1 successfully demonstrates the concept of classes and objects. It introduces how data and related functions can be grouped into a single unit (class), which helps organize and modularize code efficiently. This approach promotes reusability and easier maintenance.

Program 2
Aim:
To implement a function inside a class and calculate the volume of a cube.

Apparatus:
C++ Compiler

Text Editor or IDE

Algorithm:
Define a class cube with public attributes: height, width, and length.

Create a member function volume() to calculate and return volume.

In main(), create an object of the class and call the volume function.

Display the result using cout.

Conclusion:
Program 2 illustrates how functions can be defined inside a class. It effectively shows the calculation of volume using public data members and a member function. This implementation reflects the encapsulation feature of OOP.

Program 3
Aim:
To demonstrate the use of public and private variables in a class.

Apparatus:
C++ Compiler

Text Editor or IDE

Algorithm:
Define a class cube with private data members: height, width, length.

Create a public member function volume() to access private variables and compute volume.

Create an object of the class in main() and call the volume function.

Display the result.

Conclusion:
Program 3 successfully demonstrates data encapsulation by restricting direct access to class attributes using the private access specifier. It highlights how class functions can be used to safely access and manipulate private data.

Program 4
Aim:
To implement a display function inside a class to show computed volume.

Apparatus:
C++ Compiler

Text Editor or IDE

Algorithm:
Define a class cube with attributes for dimensions.

Implement a volume() function to calculate volume.

Implement a disp_vol() function to display the volume.

In main(), create an object of the class, call the volume() function, and pass the result to disp_vol().

Conclusion:
Program 4 effectively shows how multiple functions within a class can work together. One function performs the calculation, while another handles the display. This structure supports separation of concerns and makes the code more modular and readable.

Program 5
Aim:
To take input from the user for length, breadth, and height and calculate the volume using a class.

Apparatus:
C++ Compiler

Text Editor or IDE

Algorithm:
Define a class Volume with attributes for length, breadth, and height.

Create a function input() to take user input for all attributes.

Create a function vol() to compute volume.

Create a function display() to show the result.

In main(), create an object of the class, call input, compute volume, and display it.

Conclusion:
Program 5 showcases dynamic behavior using user input. It reinforces the use of classes to encapsulate data and behavior. Taking input, processing, and displaying results within the class improves data security and modular design.
